# NewsAggregator

## Run development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
File src/app/appConfig.ts contains constant API_ENDPOINT which must link to address of working [news-aggregator_backend](https://github.com/MaxtiCorn/news-aggregator_backend). Now this constant links to address of running [news-aggregator_backend](https://github.com/MaxtiCorn/news-aggregator_backend) with default parameters on the same machine as this project.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
